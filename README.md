# Electronic-Dice-on-FPGA-
VHDL implementation of random number generator from 1 to 6 (3 bits). 
The random nummber is displayed on common anode 7 segment display.
Hence it can be used as Electronic dice.
Implemented on Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.
.vhd is VHDL file
.ucf is user implementation file. assign IO pins on FPGA with pins in the .ucf file.
